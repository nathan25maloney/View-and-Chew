# View-and-Chew

This application was a collaboration between Saul Perea-Garayzar, Keven Valente and myself.  We each had a hand in almost every portion of this application and I couldn't have gotten it to look as good as it does without them.  

The application came about as an attempt to make planning a whole night out seemless and easy.  The landing page at https://nathan25maloney.github.io/View-and-Chew/ brings you to a form to search for local events of varying types within a certain time frame.  Upon clicking submit it redirects you to a page that shows you all the events you can choose from and information about them.  Click the button on the event of your choice and it will move the google map to the area near the event and drop clickable points for restaurants in the area.  Hence the name View-And-Chew!
